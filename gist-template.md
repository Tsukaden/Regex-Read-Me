## Summary

Regex is basically a tool used to find specific patterns of characters within text. It's used in various programming languages and applications to perform tasks like validating data input, searching through text, and manipulating strings. It's like a code that helps you identify and extract specific information from a larger body of text.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The ^ and $ symbols in the regex, which are used to match the beginning and end of a string.

### Quantifiers

The * and + symbols in the regex, which are used to match zero or more occurrences and one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. 

### Grouping Constructs

The (and) symbols in the regex, which are used to group characters or other constructs together, and can be used to apply quantifiers and other 
operators to a group as a whole.

### Bracket Expressions

The [] symbols in the regex, which are used to match a single character from a set of characters, or a range of characters.

### Character Classes

The \d, \w, and \s symbols in the regex, which are shorthand for common character classes, such as digits, word characters, and whitespace.

### The OR Operator

The | symbol in the regex, which is used to match either the expression to the left or the expression to the right of the operator.

### Flags

The g, i, and m flags in the regex, which modify how the regex engine matches patterns, such as matching multiple occurrences and ignoring case.

### Character Escapes

The \ symbol in the regex, which is used to escape special characters and allow them to be matched as literal characters.
